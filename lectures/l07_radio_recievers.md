# Rate
Assume gaming mouse limits rate.

Assume we must have one update every 1 ms

# Data Rate

Application Data Rate > 76 bits/ms = 76 kbps

Assume 30 % packet loss

Raw Data Rate > 228 kbps

Multiply by $$\pi$$ > 716 kbps

Round to nearest nice number = 1Mbps

# Range (Friis)
[.column]

Assume no antenna gain, power density p at distance D is

$$ p = \frac{P_{TX}}{4 \pi D^2}$$

Assume reciever antenna has no gain, then the effective apature is

$$ A_e = \frac{\lambda^2}{4 \pi}$$

[.column]

Power recieved is then

$$P_{RX} = \frac{P_{TX}}{D^2} \left[\frac{\lambda}{4 \pi}\right]^2$$

Or in terms of distance

$$ D = 10^\frac{P_{TX} - P_{RX} + 20 log_{10}\left(\frac{c}{4 \pi f}\right)}{20} $$

#Range (Free space)

# Single carrier, or multi carrier?

Bluetooth, 802.15.4, ANT all use one carrier
- Simple TX, constant envelope

WiFi, LTE ++ all use Ortogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
- Complex TX, non-constant envelope

|Baseband block | Why |
|---|---|
| Mixer? | If we're using low intermediate frequency to avoid DC offset problems and flicker noise|
| Channel filters?| If the AAF is insufficient for adjaecent channel|
| Power detection | To be able to control the gain of the radio|
| Phase extraction| Assuming we're using FSK|
| Timing recovery | Figure out when to slice the symbol|
| Bit detection | single slice, multi-bit slice, correlators etc, see|
| Address detection | Is the packet for us?|
| Header detection | What does the packet contain|
| CRC  | Does the packet have bit errors|
| Payload decrypt| Most links are encrypted by AES|
| Memory access| Payload need to be stored until CPU can do something|

# What do we really want, in the end?


$$P_{RX_{sens}} = -174 dBm + 10 \times log10(DR)  + NF + Eb/N0$$

for example, for nRF5340 


$$ P_{RX_{sens}} + 174 - 60 =  NF + Eb/N0 = 17 dB$$
